# MSP430FR2433 examples
Examples to help you programming the MSP430FR2433 from Texas Instruments.

I wrote this code quite a few years ago when the code for this microcontroller was not really updated, so maybe they are outdated now (although as far as I have seen in a quick view, they available official examples are not improved).

The main difference with the officially provided examples is that I make use here of the driverlib API provided by TI whenever it is possible, reducing the amount of register management that must be done by the programmer.

You can find the official examples at MSPWare.
